# Bank-Note-Authenticator-with-Flask and Heroku

In this project i have deployed a machine learning model which take into account variance, skewness, curtosis and entropy to authenticate and tell that the currency is fake or real using pickle and built a flask based website to give the result back to the user hosted on Heroku.

<h3>About The Dataset</h3>

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.
